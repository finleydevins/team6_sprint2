   FAQ about Halloween</h2>
               <h3>
                Question 1: How did Halloween start? </h3>
               
<p> <div class="text-box2">Halloween started over 2,000 years ago with the Celts, who lived in Ireland and parts of Europe. They believed that on October 31st, ghosts came back to Earth, so they lit big fires and dressed up to keep the spirits away. Later, when Christianity spread, the holiday mixed with a church day called All Saints' Day and became known as All Hallows' Eve, or Halloween. As time passed, especially in America, it turned into the fun holiday we know today, with costumes, candy, and spooky decorations</div> 

                <h3>Question 2: Why do we still celebrate Halloween today?</h3>
    
<p><div class="text-box2">We still celebrate Halloween because it’s a fun way to dress up, get candy, and enjoy spooky stuff with friends and family. Even though it started a long time ago, people today like it because it’s a chance to have fun, be creative, and enjoy scary decorations. It’s a holiday where everyone can play along and have a good time!"</div>

                <h3>Question 3: What is the history behind pumpkin carving?</h3>

<p><div class="text-box2">Pumpkin carving started with an old Irish tradition of carving turnips, not pumpkins! People would carve scary faces into them to scare away evil spirits during Samhain, a Celtic festival marking the end of harvest. When Irish immigrants came to America, they found pumpkins, which were bigger and easier to carve than turnips. Over time, carving pumpkins became a popular Halloween tradition, especially in the U.S., with the carved pumpkins known as jack-o'-lanterns. The name "jack-o'-lantern" comes from an old Irish legend about a man named Stingy Jack, who tricked the devil and wandered the Earth with a carved turnip lantern.</div>

                <h3>Question 4: Why do people give out candy for Halloween?</h3>

<p><div class="text-box2">People give out candy on Halloween as part of the tradition of trick-or-treating, which started in the early 20th century. The practice has roots in older customs where people, especially children, would go door-to-door asking for food or treats in exchange for songs, prayers, or performances during holidays like Samhain or All Souls' Day. In the 1950s, after Halloween became more child-focused in the U.S., giving out candy became the easiest and most popular way to participate. Candy companies also saw the opportunity, heavily marketing sweets for Halloween, making it a key part of the celebration</div>

                <h3>Question 5: How has Halloween changed over the years?</h3>

<p><div class="text-box2">Halloween has changed a lot over the years. It started with ancient Celtic festivals and later mixed with Christian traditions, but now it’s mostly about having fun and celebrating rather than spiritual meanings. Costumes used to be simple and scary, but now people wear all kinds of outfits, from spooky to funny, showing their creativity and trends. Trick-or-treating began as a way for kids to get food or treats for singing or praying, but now it’s just about dressing up and going door-to-door for candy, often organized by neighborhoods. Halloween has also become a big commercial holiday, with lots of candy, decorations, and costumes sold in stores starting in September. Today, the celebrations include haunted houses, pumpkin patches, and Halloween parties, making it a fun month-long celebration instead of just one day</div>
